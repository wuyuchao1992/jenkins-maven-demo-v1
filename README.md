# Performance Test Report

## 1. Introduction
This performance test was conducted using JMeter with the Selenium plugin to evaluate the front-end UI's response time when the backend database record count increases. The current database contains approximately 3600 records. Exploratory testing revealed that when the number of database records exceeds 50,000, the API response time significantly slows down.

## 2. Objective
The primary objective of this test is to determine the impact of the database record count on the front-end UI response time and to provide recommendations for further optimization and stress testing.

## 3. Test Environment
- **Test Tools**: JMeter, Selenium plugin
- **Database Record Count**: Approximately 3600 records
- **Test System**: Front-end UI
- **Test Date**: YYYY-MM-DD

## 4. Test Methodology
1. **JMeter and Selenium Plugin**: Combined usage of JMeter and the Selenium plugin for testing. JMeter generates load by simulating concurrent user requests, while the Selenium plugin simulates user interactions with the front-end UI and measures the response time.

### Detailed Steps
1. **Configure JMeter**:
   - Set up the Thread Group, configuring the number of users, ramp-up period, and test duration.
   - Use HTTP Request Sampler to simulate user requests to the front-end pages.
   - Add the Selenium plugin to simulate user interactions.

2. **Configure Selenium Plugin**:
   - Write Selenium scripts to simulate a series of user actions on the front-end UI (e.g., login, search, navigation).
   - Embed Selenium scripts into JMeter, executing them after each HTTP request.

3. **Execute Test**:
   - Start JMeter and run the test.
   - Record and analyze the front-end UI response times captured by the Selenium plugin.

## 5. Test Results
With the database containing approximately 3600 records, the front-end UI response times were as follows:
- Average Response Time: XX ms
- Maximum Response Time: XX ms
- Minimum Response Time: XX ms

## 6. Conclusion
Exploratory testing results indicate that when the database record count exceeds 50,000, the front-end UI response time significantly slows down. With only 3600 records, the response times are currently acceptable. However, to ensure system stability and performance under high load, it is recommended that the backend undergoes the following optimizations before conducting a comprehensive stress test:

1. **Database Index Optimization**: Ensure proper indexing of frequently queried columns to speed up data retrieval.
2. **Query Optimization**: Optimize SQL queries to avoid full table scans.
3. **Caching Mechanism**: Implement appropriate caching mechanisms to reduce database query frequency.
4. **Database Partitioning**: Partition large tables to enhance query performance.

## 7. Future Plans
Once the backend completes the suggested optimizations, further stress testing will be conducted to evaluate system performance under high load.
