Dear [Leader's Name],

As discussed previously, we needed to conduct a performance test on the front-end. I am now sharing the results of our recent performance test using JMeter and the Selenium plugin.

Key Findings:
Current Database Records: Approximately 3600 records
Key Observation: When the database records exceed 50,000, API response times significantly slow down.
For the detailed report, please refer to the following link: Performance Test Report.

If you have any questions or need further details, please let me know.

Best regards,
