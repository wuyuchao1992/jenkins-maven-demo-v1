Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope you're doing well.

During our recent front-end integration of AppD (Task ID: XXXX), we discovered that this integration sends requests to an external URL. To ensure we comply with our security policies and regulations, could you please confirm whether we are permitted to do this?

If there is any confusion or further information needed, please feel free to contact me.

Thank you!

Best regards,
