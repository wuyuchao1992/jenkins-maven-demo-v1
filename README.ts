Subject: Overtime Testing Schedule for November 1 Release

Dear [Manager/Project Lead],

To ensure a smooth release on November 1, our team will conduct additional testing. Based on project progress and release requirements, we plan the following overtime schedule to focus on testing efforts and maintain the quality of this release.

Overtime Schedule:

	•	Dates: From [specific dates in October] to October 31
	•	Overtime Hours: Daily from [6:00 PM - 9:00 PM] (timing may vary depending on testing progress)

Tasks to be Completed:

	1.	Functionality Testing: Conduct comprehensive verification of new modules to ensure all business logic works as expected.
	2.	Regression Testing: Test existing functionality to ensure the new release does not impact current features.
	3.	Compatibility Testing: Verify the application across different devices and browsers to maintain consistent user experience.
	4.	Performance Testing: Test key features under high concurrency scenarios to ensure system stability.
	5.	Bug Retesting: Retest identified issues to confirm that all resolved bugs are fixed and do not reoccur.

Please prepare accordingly for these overtime hours and distribute tasks based on project priorities. Don’t hesitate to reach out to me with any questions or if you need further support.

Thank you all for your hard work and cooperation!
