**Subject**: Risk Assessment for JIRA Number: xxxx Release to Production

Dear [Leader's Name],

I would like to report the current status of JIRA number: xxxx and highlight potential risks if this feature is released to production.

1. **Insufficient Testing**: This feature was merged into the master branch without undergoing sufficient testing. There is a significant potential risk that unforeseen issues may arise in the production environment.

2. **Does Not Fully Meet Requirements**: After several days of testing, the current version still does not fully meet the expected requirements. The feature is unstable and does not align with business objectives.

Based on these points, I believe that releasing this feature to production carries high risks. I recommend postponing the release until these issues are resolved. If needed, I can organize further testing and adjustments to ensure the quality and stability of the feature.

Please review the above and provide your feedback and guidance.

Thank you!

Best regards,  
[Your Name]  
[Your Position]
